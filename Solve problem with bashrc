Every time I open a new terminal I get an error if I don't call the next instruction:
$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

I have solved doing:

    Open your terminal
    Write the command --> gedit ~/.bashrc
    I file will open on gedit
    Go to the bottom (my last line was "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" , for others it may differ)
    Go under that line and write --> source [YOUR PATH]/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash    (source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash)
    Save and exit
    Now with every new shell you open, it will source automatically
